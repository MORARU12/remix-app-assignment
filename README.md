# remix-app-assignment

## Short Description

This repository contains a simple app designed to take a website URL as input and generate a corresponding sentence about the website as output. Additionally, it includes a prototype feature enabling users to click on words within the generated sentence, which opens a modal displaying their definitions. This feature aims to enhance clarity for words generated by ChatGPT that might otherwise be unclear.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
